          <a class="heading-para">What is the relevance of the topic 'Indian Parents'? I mean do they even have a part to play in our so-called adulthood. Let me tell you the story of the time I tried to move out.</a>
        </header>
         <br>
         <br>
        <p>Months before my graduation, I decided to move out. I did not have a solid plan, but I was more or less prepared for it. Did research on places to stay, finances, and the next step. Spoke to a few of my friends, took suggestions, and build on them. I knew I had one more obstacle to conquer but didn’t expect it to be this ginormous. It took some courage, but I proposed the plan to my parents. Considering the fact that I am still living at my home, they didn’t take it very well.</p>
<br>
        <p>Let’s analyze this scenario and look what went wrong here. My parents felt like I was putting myself in unnecessary danger. It felt like they wouldn’t be able to shield me from stuff anymore. They took my moving out as their own inadequacy. That they weren’t good enough or couldn’t provide enough to make me stay. Also, there was this question of ‘what would we say to people’. Even though I could identify how some of the aforementioned stuff is toxic, they weren’t bad parents either. They had my best interests at heart mostly. This lead me to the dilemma of identifying what was right and wrong when it came to my parents. It was nearly impossible to cave into their every interest however it is also difficult to not accept everything they put forth. They were the first people to identify my burnout and taught me to be uncompromising when it came to my health. They had also earlier pressured me to have a career as a doctor against my wishes to do engineering, which I obviously fought against. Maybe family doesn't come in black and white, they come in greys and you can choose how much of that can you put up with. Only you know your kin and can set boundaries as necessary.</p>
         <br>
        <p>When I was a teenager I for long wanted to cut off my parents as soon as I had a grain of financial independence. Now, however, I can empathize with the complex individuals that raised me. They definitely had some unacceptable ideals to them, as I was raised in an environment that demanded perfection even at an early age. I was taught to live to please others among many other things. The additional nuances that came along as I was a girl were also there. I had loathed them for putting me to these standards that shamed my very existence. I couldn’t understand why they couldn’t see the world as I do. My angst on some days was too much to even live with. Over the years, the anger subsided to form a space for understanding. First was learning to see them as individuals rather than entities that should be perfect. The realization that they were too the victims of societal pressure dawned soon. What I faced from them was only the outcome of the trickle-down of patriarchy that was prevalent everywhere. Also, the fact that, while I had the opportunity to explore myself, grow and form my worldview in a secure environment, they grew up in survival mode. They had to provide for their families before they had the time to grow as individuals themselves. To think of it, it is quite sad to see them move from one responsibility to another without the time or security to figure themselves out. Even as I empathize with them, it does not mean I put up with everything. Meh, it’s complicated.</p>
<p>I tested out a theory of mine recently. One of the things that I and my mom argue about, is my waking hours. She thinks it’s a little too close to lunchtime. My theory is that our parents are so invested in our lives because they did not have the opportunity to figure out what kind of life they wanted. Hence they are not as actively invested in their own lives. So after a few heart-to-heart conversations, I figured out what my mom would have done if she had some time for herself( not disclosing it to respect her privacy). After some constant persuasion, she has taken it up, and guess who can sleep till noon peacefully now?</p>
